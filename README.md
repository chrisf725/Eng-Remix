# Eng-Remix

Remix Project Assignment: You have a lot of freedom as far as how you decide to approach your Remix Project. You might want to create a poster, brochure, flyer, social media post, website, blog, podcast, video, song, dance, play, story, poem, painting, sculpture, or write a letter to an official or a letter to an editor, or something else entirely different, not on this list. Reach out to me if you are unsure or struggling with your ideas.

As you decide upon your genre/form keep in mind the following guidelines:

- Think about your audience and your purpose--to inform, persuade, call to action
- Make sure your remix is related to your course inquiry project and argument paper
- Create something original -- not an assignment you've submitted to another class.
- Decide whether you want to take chances and try something new or go with a genre you are already familiar with -- the choice is yours.

Have fun and feel free to collaborate with others as you work on your remix project.  It's okay to get assistance, support, feedback as you design and complete your project.
