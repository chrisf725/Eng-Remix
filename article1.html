            <h2>The Stock Market In a General Sense</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="para-1">Freedom is the right to be able to think, act, or speak the way they want without any obstacles in their way. In the US, many people do not really think about the freedom they have because it is a basic right, but if their freedom were to be taken away, the effect that this has on people would be massive. By taking away what they usually take for granted, it would feel like they have lost a lot and that is true. This does not necessarily happen all the time, although recently, there has been a case where certain degrees of freedom were essentially being taken away inside of the stock market. During the price surge in GameStop stock in the stock market, the stock has gained a lot of attention within the span of one to three months in early 2021. While people have set their eyes on this stock, there has been many attempts to control the flow of the stock. Although trading stock constantly changes the economy for better or worse, people should be able to freely trade their stocks without any restrictions or strings attached so no single individual or group has the power to control an economy.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>The Event That Got People Talking</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="para-1">For the people to be able to trade freely, restrictions on certain stocks should not happen in the first place. Recently, there has been a limit on how much one can buy and sell the GameStop stock in one of the free trading and investing apps known as Robinhood. Robinhood has placed restrictions on the stock within their own app because of reasons that they think will prevent anything unexpected from happening in the stock market. While the restrictions have been placed, there was an uproar from small time investors and those who were willing to buy this stock since these restrictions prevent trading large volumes of this GameStop stock. Robinhood only restricted the trades for individual investors while hedge funds and investors affiliated with institutions are able to freely trade this stock. This clearly shows that Robinhood favors more the hedge funds and institutions than the common people and sets up a divider between the rich person and the average person. Robinhood will face lawsuits as a result of their actions they have taken towards the stock, and their actions have violated one of the fundamentals of this economy and that is the free market system. As the name implies, prices that are determined in the economy are unrestricted, and Robinhood did tamper with the economy by taking this course of action. This is a form of market manipulation, and manipulating the market is a more general way of limiting the freedom of trading.

            <h2>Market Manipulation</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="para-1">Market manipulation is not something entirely new and has been going on for quite some time. It is mainly used for gaining an advantage in the market. Currently, there are some arguments that both short-sellers, and the common people are in a way manipulating the market. Part of it is true, and part of it is false. Keith Gill, an investor and an American financial analyst, is a key person when it comes to the sudden popularity in the GME stock because he was one of the people that knew about the GME stock and how that will see a rise in the near future. Gill was not the only one who knew when to invest in stock, and in fact, many also knew. He is a popular YouTuber/streamer, and therefore, his actions have gained the attention of many people. During his testimony with the Congress, Gill has said that his conversations with other investors were “no different from people in a bar, or in a golf course, or at home talking or arguing about a stock” while hedge funds and Wall Street firms “have teams of analysts working together to compile research and analyze shares of companies”. Here he claims that he and other normal investors are making investments through casual means to gain an understanding whether or not they should invest in a certain stock, and that the other hedge funds are intentionally coordinating with each other to ensure that they can essentially make the most profitable moves possible. Gill’s statement does set the differences between the common investor and hedge funds in which the investors go with the flow in the market, while hedge funds and other corporations are deliberately changing the flow. Because these big-time companies are trying to purposefully change the market to their advantage, it does limit the actions of an average investor by changing the value of the stock so that it would not seem profitable to them. These limitations make it more difficult for these investors to freely trade in the market even though they are only playing fair.

            <h2>What Exactly Can We Do?</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="para-1">Given that there are still cases of market manipulation today, all we really can do is to keep buying the stocks that seem desirable to us. It keeps the flow of the market in check, and if more people were to gain knowledge of what is happening, it can also lead to less of the hedge funds and big companies from making huge amounts of profit unfairly by making a stock's price go up, so the stock won't go bankrupt. We need to show that the invisible hand is passively in control of the economy and not big companies actively controlling it.</p>
